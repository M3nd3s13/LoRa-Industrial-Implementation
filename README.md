This repository is organized into two main folders: the Scalability Algorithms folder and the Excel-Data-Sheets-Chapter5 folder. The Scalability Algorithms folder contains two algorithms designed to simulate LoRa collisions, providing an assessment of the technology's scalability. The Excel-Data-Sheets-Chapter5 folder includes data sheets related to the Chapter 5 GP1 and GP3 simulations.
